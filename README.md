# PiYak PWA
## Piyed + Beyak (Period + Poop)

(Because keeping track of your insides shouldn't be boring!)

Welcome to the repo for Poop & Flow Tracker, the Progressive Web App (PWA) that finally brings your two most essential bodily functions together in one place: your period calendar and your daily "presents" (aka poop). We're using the totally chill Google Forms API for data storage, so your precious intel is safe and sound, plus you can creep on your friends' anonymized data, because, you know, science!

## The  Features

* Pocket PWA Power: Install this bad boy on your phone, desktop, or even your smart fridge (if it runs a browser). It’s fast, works offline, and basically lives in your pocket.
* Aunt Flo's Schedule: Log when the monthly visitor arrives and leaves. Keep that calendar looking crimson!
* The Daily Dump: A delightful counter/tracker for your bathroom triumphs. Track how often and how, well, epic it was.
* Google Forms: Our Secret Keeper: Forget complicated databases! We use the simple magic of Google Forms to submit your data directly to a hidden Google Sheet (it's low-key genius).
* Snoop on Friends (Kindly!): See your buddies' general trends (anonymously, of course!). Finally, you can compare notes on… data points.
