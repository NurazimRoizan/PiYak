# PiYak PWA
## Piyed + Beyak (Period + Poop)

(Because keeping track of your insides shouldn't be boring!)

Welcome to the repo for Poop & Flow Tracker, the Progressive Web App (PWA) that finally brings your two most essential bodily functions together in one place: your period calendar and your daily "presents" (aka poop). I'm using the simple magic of Google Forms and Sheets for data storage, plus you can creep on your friends' anonymized data, because, you know, science!

* **Aunt Flo's Schedule:** Log when the monthly visitor arrives and leaves. Keep that calendar looking crimson!
* **The Daily Dump:** A delightful counter/tracker for your bathroom triumphs. Track how often and how, well, epic it was.
* **Google Forms: Our Secret Keeper:** Forget complicated databases! We use the simple magic of Google Forms to submit your data directly to a hidden Google Sheet.
* **Snoop on Friends (Kindly!):** See your buddies' general trends (anonymously, of course!). Finally, you can compare notes on… data points.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Tracking

The **PiYak** app operates in two distinct modes—**Counter** (for daily bathroom business) and **Period** (for menstrual flow)—which you can toggle between using the switch located above the calendar. All tracking actions begin by clicking to **select a date** on the calendar.

***

#### 💩 Counter Mode (The Daily Dump)

This is the default mode used for tracking your shit everyday.

1.  **Select a Day:** Tap the date on the calendar for the day you want to track.
2.  **Increment:** Click the **`+1`** button to increase the daily count.
3.  **Decrement:** Click the **`-1`** button to correct or decrease the count.
4.  **Visualize:** The calendar day will visually reflect the count, deepening in color intensity (Gold to Deep Brown) as the number increases.

***

#### 🩸 Period Mode (Aunt Flo's Schedule)

This mode is used for marking your menstrual cycle and viewing predicted dates.

1.  **Setup Prediction (First Use):** Click the **`Settings`** button (next to the mode toggle) and enter your average **Period Length** (days of flow) and **Cycle Length** (total days from the start of one period to the start of the next). Hit **`Save`**.
2.  **Mark Flow:**
    * **Start:** Select the first day of your flow and click the **`Start Period`** button.
    * **Flow:** For any day *during* your flow, click the **`Flow`** button (Flows are automatically filled in between Start day and End day).
    * **End:** Select the last day of your flow and click the **`End Period`** button.
3.  **Correction:** If you need to clear a marking (Start, Flow, or End), select the date and click the **`Clear Marking`** button.
4.  **Prediction:** Once at least two cycles are recorded, the app will automatically display your **Predicted Period** (darker pink), **Fertile Window** (green), and **Predicted Ovulation** (gold) on the calendar.
